Modern scientific publications are a mix of impenetrable jargon, detailed technical references, ultra-dense figures, topped with a 50-page supplement.



While there are good reasons for that style of communication to exist, what has gone missing is a straightforward story that conveys the main points, without all the ifs and buts, and told in a way that a non-specialist not already familiar with the literature would understand.



Our motivation for starting this blog is to tell that story. We want to provide informal and understandable summaries of our research. In other words, we'll write our own "News & Views"!



Additionally, we will use this space to communicate technical mini-results for which there isn't a place in traditional scientific publishing. Lastly, we will share some more personal thoughts on our everyday experiences as researchers, mentors, and students in academia.



This blog is an experiment that may or may not succeed. First, we have to write something. Then someone will have to actually read it. We'll judge the experiment after the pandemic... See you then!
